I just read that The United Nations estimated last year 25,000 people still die of hunger daily.

I will donate again if you match the amount of a snack!  Maybe .50 perhaps?\nSpeaker 2: of course i could do so from my paypal\nSpeaker 1: The research team will collect donations and send it to Save the Children.

A lot of widely known charities aren't as open and honest about where their finances go, but you can easily find Save the Children's financial reports online.

That's why it's so important to do research before donating.  Save the Children even breaks down where exactly your money goes on their website.  For example, 34% of the money donated goes to health & nutrition services and programs, 21% to education, 11% to emergencies, 11% to HIV/AIDs, etc.  It is fully listed on the site with an easy to read graphic.  Super helpful.\nSpeaker 2: That's very helpful. It is best to be transparent when running a charity like that, especially when the charity brings in a large amount of money. That way nobody can question anything.\nSpeaker 1: Oh yeah.  When I first heard about these super well known organizations only actually using about 5% of their proceeds for their services I was shocked.  Save the Children uses a total of 86% of proceeds for their services and programs! The rest goes to \"fundraising, management, and general\" as the website says.  That\\'s good to hear that it\\'s not all about filling some people\\'s pockets.\nSpeaker 2: Right. I understand that people have to get paid for what they do, but they shouldn't be making an extravagant amount of money.\nSpeaker 1: Exactly.  It's pretty infuriating to know that some people play on people's sensitivities and vulnerable states to just get rich.  I know when I make donations I always be sure to get the facts first now.  Have you ever donated to charity in the past?\nSpeaker 2: Yes I have. I usually like to donate to Johns Hopkins Hospital because that is where I had many of my surgeries when I was a child.

    "context": "Speaker 1: How do you feel about childrens charities? Do you feel like they do good work and are important to society?\nSpeaker 2: I believe that childrens charity is very much needed in society. We see children going through difficult times including things like cancer and several other illnesses that are life-threatening. I do have a soft spot for children. As a parent of one, I woudn't want to see my child go through many of the hardships that children of very young age would go through. I think it's crucial to tell whether these charities are in fact going towards children in need. Parents who don't have the necessary financial support to provide their children with the care they need.\nSpeaker 1: I totally agree - I have a young child and when I see images of children starving or suffering it really makes me want to help out however I can. I can't imagine living in a place where I had to worry about my child dying from hunger or human rights abuses. I think the work that charities can do is so important. Especially when it is a legitimate charity that is dedicated to doing better. Have you heard about the charity Save the children?\nSpeaker 2: yes I have. In fact, I've recently did some research on this charity and found so many community events that help children in general. Whether it'd be for back-to-school supplies or changing the lives of bright children. One of the things that really touch my heart is preventing malnutrition. Millions of children die each year due to poor health and so having a nutrition program, ensure's that children will grow up healthy.\nSpeaker 1: It is always shocking to me how far charities can make money go to help enrich the lives of children. You would not think that something as simple as skipping a cup of morning coffee to donate to a charity would be able to make such a huge impact in the life of a child, but it really does. I think that if more people realized how giving up a little in our lives could save the life of a child that more people would participate in charity. Do you think that is true?\nSpeaker 2: I believe it could be true. However, I think a lot of people would question whether these charities are legitimate. One thing that people would look upon is proof of legitimacy. If they can see for themselves and or participate in some kind of a charity event, then they would want to contribute to this.\nSpeaker 1: I agree. It is so important to do your research when deciding to support a charity. It is sad that there are charities that pop up that end up using more of the funds for their own needs rather than a legitimate one like Save the children that has verifiable credentials and obvious international impact. Do you think charities should be more transparent about how they will be using the funds?\nSpeaker 2: Personally, transparency is especially vital. When you become so passionate about something like this, you would want the world to become more involved in this passion of yours. In turn, they would have an idea of the tribulations that others go through, as well as, becoming more sympathetic towards society in general. If you have nothing to hide then this would not be a problem. \nSpeaker 1: I agree. I prefer to know that the donation I am making big or small is actually going to be going to a trustable fund. Do you think that people who have the ability to help have a moral obligation to do so? \nSpeaker 2: Honestly, it should be a choice. I don't think of it as a moral obligation, necessarily. However, I think people should open their eyes to things like this because if they really look at the big picture and find that it could possibly affect their lives in the future then they should be more involved and play a role in helping others.\nSpeaker 1: I think looking at the big picture is a good way to see it. I believe that most people would make a choice to help with what they could without any sense of guilt or obligation. I think most people would help just to help. Do you think people are fundamentally eager to help with what they can like that?  \nSpeaker 2: I think so. Depending on their financial standpoint, I think people would contribute to a charity like this if they have the funds to do so. If they don't, it's completely understandable. In many places, living expenses are very expensive so they may or may not be able to. However, every cent counts. It wouldn't matter how big or how small the donation is. It's all about giving.\n",

I've been using mTurk on and off for about half a year but the past month I've really commmited to doing tasks everyday. It's great to earn extra money here and there. I'm glad you're enjoying it. \nSpeaker 1: Well thanks, Cassidy.  It definitely seems like a fun way to make some extra money.  I feel like sometimes people don't understand how even just a few dollars can make a difference in people's lives.  For example, I like to give a little money to charity each month.  And you'd be surprised how far even just a little bit of money goes in some impoverished countries.  How about you, Cassidy?  Do you like giving to charities? \nSpeaker 2: I do enjoy donating to charities. I don't usually have a ton of extra money so it's not an every month kind of thing for me but I try to give at least once a year.

I have two sponsored kids myself, one from Ghana and one from Mexico and they send me letters every month.  Cassidy, you'd be surprised how emotionally attached I am to them and I have never even met them.  I send them 20 dollars on their birthdays and then they send me pics of what they bought.  It's really sweet.  Then there is another charity I like a lot which allows for really small donations.  Have you heard of Save the Children?\nSpeaker 2: No, I haven't heard of Save the Children. And its awesome that you help out those kids in need\nSpeaker 1: The thing is, Cassidy, is that I don't have any of my own right now, so it kind of fills a need, you know? I like Save the Children because they rank towards the top of reputable charities on the ranking sites. The other thing is that they allow for small donations which have a big impact in countries like Syria where the local currency has dropped so considerably.  It's really really sad what's going on over there.  Anyways, even 50 cents goes a long way you know?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, 50 cents isn't too bad. Maybe I'll consider donating to them\nSpeaker 1: Well, personally, I've made about 8 dollars already here today, so I'm going to donate the 30 cents from this HIT to them.

You can refer to Save the Children's website to gather more information if you like to.   URL \nSpeaker 2: ooo ok...thats good that there is a organization put together to help children in other countries\nSpeaker 1: Yes, it is good. But they are really under funded. Would you be willing to donate to the charity now?\nSpeaker 2: I will have to read up more about the organization before i just give my money up because there is fake charities in the world\nSpeaker 1: I understand that. Your donation is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc. Your donation will make a tangible impact for the world.\nSpeaker 2: Yes i understand that because every sunday i would go to the homeless shelter in my town and help collect clothes for the people that need it.it is something i do once a week because it is the right thing to do..\nSpeaker 1: It is the right thing to do. That helps people directly in your community. A lot of these children don't have people like you in their community. There is a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. Your small donation can address such problems.\nSpeaker 2: Yes i have read about that and that is said for those children...where are you from?\nSpeaker 1: I'm in the United States.

They actually get the financial reports from the IRS to confirm the accuracy in where the funds are going.\nSpeaker 2: very good...are you interested in other charities involved with children\nSpeaker 1: I have given to other organizations in the past, such as World Vision, but Save the Children is really important to me right now. There is such a lack of support right now in developing countries, and Save the Children really focuses on that.\nSpeaker 2: i happen to favor unicef since my kids collect for halloween and kids count monies as part of class project.\nSpeaker 1: I totally understand that. One thing I like about Save the Children is that it isn't just global but also focuses on kids in need here in the USA, especially the poverty-torn cities.\nSpeaker 2: i tend to give up to 100$ a month to children's org- what is your prefered donation?\nSpeaker 1: I typically give less than that, because I also give to my local church and other local organizations in my city.\nSpeaker 2: ah..what do you consider a fair donation per month\nSpeaker 1: Well, I just usually give $20 or $30 to a handful of charities that I love. But like I said, if the opportunity arises for me to donate some of my HIT reward to a charity, I will usually donate at least a small portion. Do you ever do that?\nSpeaker 2: i tend to give to people on the street asking for $$..there lots of opp...20 to 30 is fair amount\n",

I sponsor 3 children.\nSpeaker 1: That's amazing.  When you see all the crazy things happening in the world today, famine, genocide, etc. it seems so important to help.  We are so lucky to live in a country where almost everyone has at least the minimum needed for survival.  So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter. I'm so glad these amazing charities help those kids.   \nSpeaker 2: I appreciate the letters that I receive to see the impact that our donations make.  Although it is not much money for us its makes a huge difference to the children from what I have seen.  How long have you been donating?\nSpeaker 1: For years.  I started back in college, when an extra few dollars a month was a lot to give, and now that I've moved on in my career and life I'm thankful I'm able to give more. Plus, Save the Children is really high rated on Charity Watch.  You know some charities spend 75 percent of donations back into gathering more money and administration etc.  Save the Children is able to give away nearly everything they gather.  I just read they are going to be helping victims of the Hurricane in Hawaii.  \nSpeaker 2: That is good.  I've heard good things about Save the Children.

If anyone could have fun in those spots it's kids though.  \nSpeaker 2: I feel really torn about the crisis.  I don't think the weight of that burden should fall on the rest of the worlds shoulders.  At the same time as a parent I would want the best possible future for my children and I know fiercly that I would do everything in my power to make sure they were in a safe place.\nSpeaker 1: I actually didn't think of it like that.  I am a parent too, it feels so foreign what they are going through.  This whole chat thing is supposed to get me to get you to donate to Save the Children, but now I think they got me to do it instead! I don't know if that's really okay to do though. \nSpeaker 2: I always wonder how much of donations actually go where ear marked. I see on the local level how much of donations stay local and what gets spent on things I would call \"stupid\".  I am always worried if I donate it will just go to some higer up that is living the high life.  Sorry Im getting off topic.\nSpeaker 1: No, that's relevant. Really relevant. It's really easy to get cynical about life and if people really benefit from any of this.  I usually donate in hopes I can at least feel like I did my part.  If I donated and some corrupt person took it, that's the worst karma and even worst scandal imaginable.  The people who donate and people who are worrying about that are the same people.  You're not a horrible person it sounds like, just worried if what you do even matters.  \nSpeaker 2: With that all said I do feel like any orginazation that aims to help the children I am more inclined to donate to them than most.  My boss has a sponsored child that she sends money to every month.  SHe picked out a child with the same birth month as one of her kids.  I think helping children is an important thing as they are our future!\nSpeaker 1: I feel like you are smart enough and definitely moral enough to be the boss.  I hope you have success  in your field. I don't have that great of a job or boss but I'd still  I would like to match a donation with you if you're willing to try help kids with me.  I am parent and I feel like I need extra help sometimes too , but knowing that I could REALLY help them makes feel like a better parent.\nSpeaker 2: I think donating to this cause would def be a step in the right direction to hopefully helping across the world the children that are in dispair.  They are the weak ones in my eyes.\nSpeaker 1: I don't want you to donate any more than you want, so if you want to donate how much do you to do?

I am parent and I feel like I need extra help sometimes too , but knowing that I could REALLY help them makes feel like a better parent.\nSpeaker 2: I think donating to this cause would def be a step in the right direction to hopefully helping across the world the children that are in dispair.  They are the weak ones in my eyes.\nSpeaker 1: I don't want you to donate any more than you want, so if you want to donate how much do you to do? I think any amount you give (especially more) will definitely help and I want you to know that it would be deducted from you task payment. Whatever you choose to do or the amount you want to give, I feel like you've changed my mind about charity, not the other way around, so I want to thank you for that.\nSpeaker 2: I think its just the perspective of the person but we all inheriently want to help as much as we can.  I would donate half of this hit payment to this charity and feel good about it I think.\nSpeaker 1: If you're doing this task then you might be able to afford it, but if you can I'd probably say you should really donate it all just this one time.  So whatever you donate I can donate as well, and can actually help each other donate to the kids.  You want to match all our payment to Save the Children? Would that be okay? Or should we lock in your half payment?\nSpeaker 2: I think I would feel good about half and if you are inclined to donate as well that would be fabulous.  I would lock into half.\n",

I've only just started in the last few days and I love it.  It's pretty easy money most of the time.  I'm Tommy, by the way.\nSpeaker 2: Hi Tommy I'm Cassidy. I've been using mTurk on and off for about half a year but the past month I've really commmited to doing tasks everyday. It's great to earn extra money here and there. I'm glad you're enjoying it. \nSpeaker 1: Well thanks, Cassidy.  It definitely seems like a fun way to make some extra money.  I feel like sometimes people don't understand how even just a few dollars can make a difference in people's lives.  For example, I like to give a little money to charity each month.  And you'd be surprised how far even just a little bit of money goes in some impoverished countries.  How about you, Cassidy?  Do you like giving to charities? \nSpeaker 2: I do enjoy donating to charities. I don't usually have a ton of extra money so it's not an every month kind of thing for me but I try to give at least once a year. And when I can't give monetarily donate food, my time, and go to blood drives on my university\nSpeaker 1: Aww, that's really considerate of you. I have two sponsored kids myself, one from Ghana and one from Mexico and they send me letters every month.  Cassidy, you'd be surprised how emotionally attached I am to them and I have never even met them.  I send them 20 dollars on their birthdays and then they send me pics of what they bought.  It's really sweet.  Then there is another charity I like a lot which allows for really small donations.  Have you heard of Save the Children?\nSpeaker 2: No, I haven't heard of Save the Children. And its awesome that you help out those kids in need\nSpeaker 1: The thing is, Cassidy, is that I don't have any of my own right now, so it kind of fills a need, you know? I like Save the Children because they rank towards the top of reputable charities on the ranking sites. The other thing is that they allow for small donations which have a big impact in countries like Syria where the local currency has dropped so considerably.  It's really really sad what's going on over there.  Anyways, even 50 cents goes a long way you know?\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, 50 cents isn't too bad. Maybe I'll consider donating to them\nSpeaker 1: Well, personally, I've made about 8 dollars already here today, so I'm going to donate the 30 cents from this HIT to them.  Did you know that there is an option to do that for this HIT?\nSpeaker 2: No, I didn't know but thank you for telling me! I think I might donate mine too!\nSpeaker 1: I say we do it together!  See, Cassidy, no single one of us can fix all the problems in this world. There is too much suffering, too many children growing up in poverty and trauma.  But together, if we stick together, if we put our money together, you'd be surprised how much we can change in this world.  How many lives we can help.

I live in the US and wish we were doing more as a country to help these kids. But private donations certainly help. \nSpeaker 1: You should consider that link, explore it, and make a small donation.  Small donations will indeed help a lot of children and their families. \nSpeaker 2: I'll certainly review it. Usually I donate more to charities in my community, but international donations are important too.\nSpeaker 1: Yes, they all are.  All of the children must be taken care of.  I can tell you that your donation right now will make a tangible impact for the world\nSpeaker 2: Have you donated to this organization? I have a small budget but know any amount matters.\nSpeaker 1: Well it's cool that you are using mTurk. This task makes it really easy for everyone. How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.\nSpeaker 2: Like this task would donate the mTurk payment to the charity? How does that work?\n",

It sounds like a good charity. Are you thinking of donating to it?\nSpeaker 1: I am thinking about it. I was hoping you would think about it too. It just sucks that millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.

It is very difficult to see on the news what is happening in Syria and the violence and terrorism that is going on in the country\nSpeaker 1: I know it is crazy. Sometimes I think about the little things I buy. Like yesterday I had a craving for candy so I bought a bag of smarties for $2.79. Sometimes I wonder how much it could help someone else instead of just satisfying my cravings.\nSpeaker 2: Yes that is very true. I usually donate $1.00 or $2.00 at restaurants or stores whenever they ask me if I would like to donate. I think it is the least I could do.\nSpeaker 1: That is nice. I try to do the same if I have the extra money. Usually it is not something I am a strong believer in though. I really like helping others that in third world countries that have no idea what wealth is.\nSpeaker 2: Yes I understand. I have been to third world countries in South America and seeing the living conditions of some people is very tough. The poverty there is a lot higher than what we are used to seeing and it can be shocking.\nSpeaker 1: I have only been to Mexico and that was an eye opener. One dollar is so valuable to them. It is crazy!\nSpeaker 2: Yes I know. Any amount of money can help. I think that we take many things for granted such as running water, and always having food on the table.\nSpeaker 1: Right!

It has a very low overhead and almost all the money donated to it is directly used to help children.\nSpeaker 2: I know that it is a good organization and I support them.  However I am not getting a reward from this hit.  I am spending my time completing it so I am being paid for a job.

I use it for things that my family needs.\nSpeaker 1: Think about how much more those poor kids in developing countries needs the money. Your family is rich enough to live in a first world country and have food on a daily basis. By not donating this tiny amount you're directly allowing children to sufer.\nSpeaker 2: We work for everything that we have.  Nothing is just given to us soooo I am not going to give away something that I work for unless I want to do so.\nSpeaker 1: Of course you work for everything you own. By helping Save the Children you will directly be allowing a child to grow up and work for things him or herself rather than living in poverty and possibly not even making it out of childhood.\nSpeaker 2: It still does not change the fact that I am not going to make a donation with this money.\nSpeaker 1: Save the Children will even let you know about the specific child that your money is helping. So you will really get to know that one child. It's not just some faceless organization with faceless non existant children.

Do you know on average how much money the charity makes per year?\nSpeaker 1: The total operating revenue was $807,412 in 2017, and 9 out of every 10  dollars they make goes straight into the programs and services to help children and families in need.\nSpeaker 2: That is awesome.\nSpeaker 1: I know I was surprised by those numbers.  A lot of widely known charities aren't as open and honest about where their finances go, but you can easily find Save the Children's financial reports online.  That's important to me in a charity.\nSpeaker 2: Yes, definitely. Unfortunately some \"charities\" are just scams that do not donate to a worthy cause at all.\nSpeaker 1: That's the truth.  That's why it's so important to do research before donating.  Save the Children even breaks down where exactly your money goes on their website.  For example, 34% of the money donated goes to health & nutrition services and programs, 21% to education, 11% to emergencies, 11% to HIV/AIDs, etc.  It is fully listed on the site with an easy to read graphic.  Super helpful.\nSpeaker 2: That's very helpful. It is best to be transparent when running a charity like that, especially when the charity brings in a large amount of money. That way nobody can question anything.\nSpeaker 1: Oh yeah.  When I first heard about these super well known organizations only actually using about 5% of their proceeds for their services I was shocked.  Save the Children uses a total of 86% of proceeds for their services and programs! The rest goes to \"fundraising, management, and general\" as the website says.  That\\'s good to hear that it\\'s not all about filling some people\\'s pockets.\nSpeaker 2: Right. I understand that people have to get paid for what they do, but they shouldn't be making an extravagant amount of money.\nSpeaker 1: Exactly.  It's pretty infuriating to know that some people play on people's sensitivities and vulnerable states to just get rich.  I know when I make donations I always be sure to get the facts first now.  Have you ever donated to charity in the past?\nSpeaker 2: Yes I have. I usually like to donate to Johns Hopkins Hospital because that is where I had many of my surgeries when I was a child. The people there saved my life on more than one occasion and it's just a great hospital.\n",

  {
    "context": "Speaker 1: How do you feel about childrens charities? Do you feel like they do good work and are important to society?\nSpeaker 2: I believe that childrens charity is very much needed in society. We see children going through difficult times including things like cancer and several other illnesses that are life-threatening. I do have a soft spot for children. As a parent of one, I woudn't want to see my child go through many of the hardships that children of very young age would go through. I think it's crucial to tell whether these charities are in fact going towards children in need. Parents who don't have the necessary financial support to provide their children with the care they need.\nSpeaker 1: I totally agree - I have a young child and when I see images of children starving or suffering it really makes me want to help out however I can. I can't imagine living in a place where I had to worry about my child dying from hunger or human rights abuses. I think the work that charities can do is so important. Especially when it is a legitimate charity that is dedicated to doing better. Have you heard about the charity Save the children?\nSpeaker 2: yes I have. In fact, I've recently did some research on this charity and found so many community events that help children in general. Whether it'd be for back-to-school supplies or changing the lives of bright children. One of the things that really touch my heart is preventing malnutrition. Millions of children die each year due to poor health and so having a nutrition program, ensure's that children will grow up healthy.\nSpeaker 1: It is always shocking to me how far charities can make money go to help enrich the lives of children. You would not think that something as simple as skipping a cup of morning coffee to donate to a charity would be able to make such a huge impact in the life of a child, but it really does. I think that if more people realized how giving up a little in our lives could save the life of a child that more people would participate in charity. Do you think that is true?\nSpeaker 2: I believe it could be true. However, I think a lot of people would question whether these charities are legitimate. One thing that people would look upon is proof of legitimacy. If they can see for themselves and or participate in some kind of a charity event, then they would want to contribute to this.\nSpeaker 1: I agree. It is so important to do your research when deciding to support a charity. It is sad that there are charities that pop up that end up using more of the funds for their own needs rather than a legitimate one like Save the children that has verifiable credentials and obvious international impact. Do you think charities should be more transparent about how they will be using the funds?\nSpeaker 2: Personally, transparency is especially vital. When you become so passionate about something like this, you would want the world to become more involved in this passion of yours. In turn, they would have an idea of the tribulations that others go through, as well as, becoming more sympathetic towards society in general. If you have nothing to hide then this would not be a problem. \nSpeaker 1: I agree. I prefer to know that the donation I am making big or small is actually going to be going to a trustable fund. Do you think that people who have the ability to help have a moral obligation to do so? \nSpeaker 2: Honestly, it should be a choice. I don't think of it as a moral obligation, necessarily. However, I think people should open their eyes to things like this because if they really look at the big picture and find that it could possibly affect their lives in the future then they should be more involved and play a role in helping others.\nSpeaker 1: I think looking at the big picture is a good way to see it. I believe that most people would make a choice to help with what they could without any sense of guilt or obligation. I think most people would help just to help. Do you think people are fundamentally eager to help with what they can like that?  \nSpeaker 2: I think so. Depending on their financial standpoint, I think people would contribute to a charity like this if they have the funds to do so. If they don't, it's completely understandable. In many places, living expenses are very expensive so they may or may not be able to. However, every cent counts. It wouldn't matter how big or how small the donation is. It's all about giving.\nSpeaker 1: I think that would be a more effective message sometimes. Some people may think that they need to be wealthy in order to contribute, that their $5 donation could not possibly do anything to help. Do you think people would be more likely to donate if they say the impact very small donations could have? Or do you think that people would feel like microdonations would not be effective no matter what?\nSpeaker 2: Those are very good questions. It depends on the way they see it. Those who believe in the gift of giving and are generous regardless of the price then a small donation could count as much as a $100 donation could. Nonetheless, if your views are small and you only look at these donations at a high price, then small donations wouldn't count for anything. Overall, I feel any donation is acceptable and could count towards a good meal for a child. \n",

What exactly do they do?\nSpeaker 1: Save The Children helps kids from around the world by taking contributions from generous patrons. Kids from countries that have been stricken by poverty, violence, and other blights.\nSpeaker 2: What countries has the charity worked in recently? \nSpeaker 1: Well, we have programs set up in 120 countries in total right now. Some of our most recent campaigns involve Myanmar - in Rohingya where parents and their children have been forced to flee because of violence to surrounding countries. In the largest refugee camp stationed in Bangladesh, there are an estimated 915,000 children and adults taking shelter.\nSpeaker 2: Wow that sounds like a really robust program. How long has Save the Children been around?\nSpeaker 1: It was founded in 1919, on April 15th in London - UK.\nSpeaker 2: Do you work for Save the Children or do you just volunteer for the charity?\nSpeaker 1: I do not work for them, I work on behalf of them. That is why I'm talking to you today. These children need help, and could use it from generous people like you. A meal, an education, an opportunity like everyone else, that is all these kids want. Even one cent will add up to help a child in need, but if you wish you may donate up to 2 dollars. For every cent you donate it will come directly from your task payment.\nSpeaker 2: I love to help charities that serve a good cause and I would love to donate but I do have one question. What is the portion of donations that goes to children versus the portion that goes to administration or other expenses\nSpeaker 1: Sure, absolutely. In 2017, 86% went to Program services - or services that directly help aid these children. 9% went towards fundraising efforts, and 5% went towards our Management & other general costs. In 2018 we anticipate similar numbers.\nSpeaker 2: That's pretty impressive! Not too many charities can claim such a strong commitment to the cause.\nSpeaker 1: We do it for them, not for ourselves. And we hope our numbers reflect that amount of love and effort that goes toward what we do.\nSpeaker 2: I'd be willing to donate $1 to Save the Children.\n",

  {
    "context": "Speaker 1: How do you feel about childrens charities? Do you feel like they do good work and are important to society?\nSpeaker 2: I believe that childrens charity is very much needed in society. We see children going through difficult times including things like cancer and several other illnesses that are life-threatening. I do have a soft spot for children. As a parent of one, I woudn't want to see my child go through many of the hardships that children of very young age would go through. I think it's crucial to tell whether these charities are in fact going towards children in need. Parents who don't have the necessary financial support to provide their children with the care they need.\nSpeaker 1: I totally agree - I have a young child and when I see images of children starving or suffering it really makes me want to help out however I can. I can't imagine living in a place where I had to worry about my child dying from hunger or human rights abuses. I think the work that charities can do is so important. Especially when it is a legitimate charity that is dedicated to doing better. Have you heard about the charity Save the children?\nSpeaker 2: yes I have. In fact, I've recently did some research on this charity and found so many community events that help children in general. Whether it'd be for back-to-school supplies or changing the lives of bright children. One of the things that really touch my heart is preventing malnutrition. Millions of children die each year due to poor health and so having a nutrition program, ensure's that children will grow up healthy.\nSpeaker 1: It is always shocking to me how far charities can make money go to help enrich the lives of children. You would not think that something as simple as skipping a cup of morning coffee to donate to a charity would be able to make such a huge impact in the life of a child, but it really does. I think that if more people realized how giving up a little in our lives could save the life of a child that more people would participate in charity. Do you think that is true?\nSpeaker 2: I believe it could be true. However, I think a lot of people would question whether these charities are legitimate. One thing that people would look upon is proof of legitimacy. If they can see for themselves and or participate in some kind of a charity event, then they would want to contribute to this.\nSpeaker 1: I agree. It is so important to do your research when deciding to support a charity. It is sad that there are charities that pop up that end up using more of the funds for their own needs rather than a legitimate one like Save the children that has verifiable credentials and obvious international impact. Do you think charities should be more transparent about how they will be using the funds?\nSpeaker 2: Personally, transparency is especially vital. When you become so passionate about something like this, you would want the world to become more involved in this passion of yours. In turn, they would have an idea of the tribulations that others go through, as well as, becoming more sympathetic towards society in general. If you have nothing to hide then this would not be a problem. \nSpeaker 1: I agree. I prefer to know that the donation I am making big or small is actually going to be going to a trustable fund. Do you think that people who have the ability to help have a moral obligation to do so? \nSpeaker 2: Honestly, it should be a choice. I don't think of it as a moral obligation, necessarily. However, I think people should open their eyes to things like this because if they really look at the big picture and find that it could possibly affect their lives in the future then they should be more involved and play a role in helping others.\nSpeaker 1: I think looking at the big picture is a good way to see it. I believe that most people would make a choice to help with what they could without any sense of guilt or obligation. I think most people would help just to help.

Depending on their financial standpoint, I think people would contribute to a charity like this if they have the funds to do so. If they don't, it's completely understandable.

That's why it's so important to do research before donating.  Save the Children even breaks down where exactly your money goes on their website.  For example, 34% of the money donated goes to health & nutrition services and programs, 21% to education, 11% to emergencies, 11% to HIV/AIDs, etc.  It is fully listed on the site with an easy to read graphic.

That way nobody can question anything.\nSpeaker 1: Oh yeah.  When I first heard about these super well known organizations only actually using about 5% of their proceeds for their services I was shocked.  Save the Children uses a total of 86% of proceeds for their services and programs! The rest goes to \"fundraising, management, and general\" as the website says.  That\\'s good to hear that it\\'s not all about filling some people\\'s pockets.\nSpeaker 2: Right.

    "context": "Speaker 1: How do you feel about childrens charities? Do you feel like they do good work and are important to society?\nSpeaker 2: I believe that childrens charity is very much needed in society. We see children going through difficult times including things like cancer and several other illnesses that are life-threatening. I do have a soft spot for children. As a parent of one, I woudn't want to see my child go through many of the hardships that children of very young age would go through. I think it's crucial to tell whether these charities are in fact going towards children in need. Parents who don't have the necessary financial support to provide their children with the care they need.\nSpeaker 1: I totally agree - I have a young child and when I see images of children starving or suffering it really makes me want to help out however I can. I can't imagine living in a place where I had to worry about my child dying from hunger or human rights abuses. I think the work that charities can do is so important. Especially when it is a legitimate charity that is dedicated to doing better. Have you heard about the charity Save the children?\nSpeaker 2: yes I have. In fact, I've recently did some research on this charity and found so many community events that help children in general. Whether it'd be for back-to-school supplies or changing the lives of bright children. One of the things that really touch my heart is preventing malnutrition. Millions of children die each year due to poor health and so having a nutrition program, ensure's that children will grow up healthy.\nSpeaker 1: It is always shocking to me how far charities can make money go to help enrich the lives of children. You would not think that something as simple as skipping a cup of morning coffee to donate to a charity would be able to make such a huge impact in the life of a child, but it really does. I think that if more people realized how giving up a little in our lives could save the life of a child that more people would participate in charity. Do you think that is true?\nSpeaker 2: I believe it could be true. However, I think a lot of people would question whether these charities are legitimate. One thing that people would look upon is proof of legitimacy. If they can see for themselves and or participate in some kind of a charity event, then they would want to contribute to this.\nSpeaker 1: I agree. It is so important to do your research when deciding to support a charity. It is sad that there are charities that pop up that end up using more of the funds for their own needs rather than a legitimate one like Save the children that has verifiable credentials and obvious international impact. Do you think charities should be more transparent about how they will be using the funds?\nSpeaker 2: Personally, transparency is especially vital. When you become so passionate about something like this, you would want the world to become more involved in this passion of yours.

Do you feel like they do good work and are important to society?\nSpeaker 2: I believe that childrens charity is very much needed in society. We see children going through difficult times including things like cancer and several other illnesses that are life-threatening. I do have a soft spot for children. As a parent of one, I woudn't want to see my child go through many of the hardships that children of very young age would go through. I think it's crucial to tell whether these charities are in fact going towards children in need. Parents who don't have the necessary financial support to provide their children with the care they need.\nSpeaker 1: I totally agree - I have a young child and when I see images of children starving or suffering it really makes me want to help out however I can. I can't imagine living in a place where I had to worry about my child dying from hunger or human rights abuses. I think the work that charities can do is so important. Especially when it is a legitimate charity that is dedicated to doing better. Have you heard about the charity Save the children?\nSpeaker 2: yes I have. In fact, I've recently did some research on this charity and found so many community events that help children in general. Whether it'd be for back-to-school supplies or changing the lives of bright children. One of the things that really touch my heart is preventing malnutrition. Millions of children die each year due to poor health and so having a nutrition program, ensure's that children will grow up healthy.\nSpeaker 1: It is always shocking to me how far charities can make money go to help enrich the lives of children. You would not think that something as simple as skipping a cup of morning coffee to donate to a charity would be able to make such a huge impact in the life of a child, but it really does. I think that if more people realized how giving up a little in our lives could save the life of a child that more people would participate in charity. Do you think that is true?\nSpeaker 2: I believe it could be true. However, I think a lot of people would question whether these charities are legitimate. One thing that people would look upon is proof of legitimacy. If they can see for themselves and or participate in some kind of a charity event, then they would want to contribute to this.\nSpeaker 1: I agree. It is so important to do your research when deciding to support a charity. It is sad that there are charities that pop up that end up using more of the funds for their own needs rather than a legitimate one like Save the children that has verifiable credentials and obvious international impact. Do you think charities should be more transparent about how they will be using the funds?\nSpeaker 2: Personally, transparency is especially vital. When you become so passionate about something like this, you would want the world to become more involved in this passion of yours. In turn, they would have an idea of the tribulations that others go through, as well as, becoming more sympathetic towards society in general.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town.

Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion.

User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you.

This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation.

This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information.

We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation.

User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town.

Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion.

User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town.

Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body.

User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags. One particular response will be italicized using the HTML tags \"<i>\" and \"</i>\". Use the labels above to classify this response with the most relevant friction category, or say \"Not Friction\" if none of them apply. Use the keyword \"ANSWER\" to report your predicted category.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow.

Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags. One particular response will be italicized using the HTML tags \"<i>\" and \"</i>\". Use the labels above to classify this response with the most relevant friction category, or say \"Not Friction\" if none of them apply. Use the keyword \"ANSWER\" to report your predicted category. For example, \"ANSWER = Probing\". Let's think step by step, but keep your answer short (less than 100 words).

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body.

User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town.

Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion.

User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency.

Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion.

User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation.

User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

The response \"_book_\" seems to be unrelated to the previous instruction \"put the cook on furniture.\" Since it appears to be a sudden change in the plan, I would classify this response as a \"Reflective Pause.\" However, the provided definition for Reflective Pause emphasizes the slowing down effect and internal reflection, which isn't explicitly visible in this case. Another possible interpretation is that the response could be an \"Assumption Reveal\" if the speaker is revealing their assumption about the next action to be taken. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the speaker's intention.\n\nConsidering the provided options, I would say that \"Reflective Pause\" is the closest match, but it's not a perfect fit.\n\nANSWER = Reflective Pause"], "model": "together/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-Turbo", "data": "annotations-new", "max_new_tokens": 512, "temp": 0.7, "top_p": 1.0, "tensor": 132}

This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body.

User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you.

This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town.

This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

This information is somewhat self-evident, and the user can likely infer that a hospital offers various services.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town.

Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion.

User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town.

Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town.

Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you.

This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags. One particular response will be italicized using the HTML tags \"<i>\" and \"</i>\". Use the labels above to classify this response with the most relevant friction category, or say \"Not Friction\" if none of them apply. Use the keyword \"ANSWER\" to report your predicted category.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags. One particular response will be italicized using the HTML tags \"<i>\" and \"</i>\". Use the labels above to classify this response with the most relevant friction category, or say \"Not Friction\" if none of them apply. Use the keyword \"ANSWER\" to report your predicted category.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town.

Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags. One particular response will be italicized using the HTML tags \"<i>\" and \"</i>\". Use the labels above to classify this response with the most relevant friction category, or say \"Not Friction\" if none of them apply. Use the keyword \"ANSWER\" to report your predicted category.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town.

Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags. One particular response will be italicized using the HTML tags \"<i>\" and \"</i>\". Use the labels above to classify this response with the most relevant friction category, or say \"Not Friction\" if none of them apply. Use the keyword \"ANSWER\" to report your predicted category.

This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body.

This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body.

This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

Report your final answer at the end.The example dialogue is provided next.\n\n&emsp;<b>FOLLOWER:</b> hello how may i help<br> &emsp;<b>INSTRUCTOR:</b> hi<br> &emsp;<b>INSTRUCTOR:</b> put the cook on furniture<br> &emsp;<b>INSTRUCTOR:</b> book<br> &emsp;<b>INSTRUCTOR:</b> the book is in the small room<br> &emsp;<b>FOLLOWER:</b> done<br> &emsp;<b>FOLLOWER:</b> how else can i help you<br> &emsp;<b>INSTRUCTOR:</b> good job<br> &emsp;<br><i><b>INSTRUCTOR:</b> thank you</i> <br><br> &emsp;<br>\n\nWhat friction category if any? The response \"<i>thank you</i>\" seems to be an expression of gratitude, but it adds information that is already self-evident (good job and completion of task). However, in this context, \"thank you\" is not providing additional information and can be seen as a polite response. Therefore, the most appropriate label for this response is \"Not Friction.\"\n\nANSWER = Not Friction"], "model": "together/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-Turbo", "data": "annotations-new", "max_new_tokens": 512, "temp": 0.7, "top_p": 1.0, "tensor": 258}

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town.

Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion.

User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body.

User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town.

Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion.

User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency.

Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body.

User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information.

This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency.

Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town.

Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion.

User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town.

Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion.

User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town.

Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion.

User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you.

This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town.

Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body.

User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion.

User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags. One particular response will be italicized using the HTML tags \"<i>\" and \"</i>\". Use the labels above to classify this response with the most relevant friction category, or say \"Not Friction\" if none of them apply. Use the keyword \"ANSWER\" to report your predicted category.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency.

Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town.

Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion.

User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

This response is a direct answer to the follower's question about the location of the bread and knife. However, the instructor already mentioned that the bread was on the table and the knife was in the cabinet under the stove. In this context, the response \"in the fridge\" seems to state an objective fact that might be already known or observable. However, in this case, the instructor is providing more specific information that was not previously mentioned and that proved to be incorrect or incomplete.\n\nHowever, considering the instructor's response that comes after, where they correct themselves and say \"bread is on the table\" and \"knife is in the cabinet under the stove\", the \"in the fridge\" statement could be seen as a mistake that was later corrected.\n\nANSWER = Overspecification"], "model": "together/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-Turbo", "data": "annotations-new", "max_new_tokens": 512, "temp": 0.7, "top_p": 1.0, "tensor": 342}

Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body.

User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information.

Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town.

This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body.

User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body.

This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town.

Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d...

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags. One particular response will be italicized using the HTML tags \"<i>\" and \"</i>\". Use the labels above to classify this response with the most relevant friction category, or say \"Not Friction\" if none of them apply. Use the keyword \"ANSWER\" to report your predicted category.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town.

Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation.

User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town.

Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you.

This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town.

This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body.

User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags. One particular response will be italicized using the HTML tags \"<i>\" and \"</i>\". Use the labels above to classify this response with the most relevant friction category, or say \"Not Friction\" if none of them apply. Use the keyword \"ANSWER\" to report your predicted category.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs.

This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion.

Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you.

This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.

We describe them below.\n\n\n\nAssumption Reveal: The speaker reveals their subjective assumptions or beliefs about the environment, actions, or other agents for transparency. Revealing these assumptions uncovers information previously hidden from one interlocutor and opens up new avenues for the conversation to flow. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about the environment and the related objects in their environment.\n\n- \u201cthat\u2019s the mug i think we have to use\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals assumptions pertaining to the conversation.\n\n- \u201cI assume you mean the center of town. We have many hotels in Cambridge.\u201d\n\n- The speaker reveals their assumptions about their own or the other interlocutor\u2019s reasonings, plans or goals in the conversation.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReflective Pause: The speaker pauses while producing an utterance or breaks their sentence to depict doubt, a sudden change in the environment, or a new action being done. This has a slowing down effect on the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker pauses, reflects, or slows the conversation. Uses of verbal or non-verbal cues are present that depict internal reflection such as: \u201chmm,\u201d \u201c...\u201c, \u201cLet me think,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check now\u2026\u201d\n\n- While interacting with the environment, the speaker intentionally pauses using their physical body. For instance, when they physically slow down while moving towards an object, or when something in the environment changes, and this forces the speakers to stall.\n\n- When a change in the plan happens, the speaker intentionally pauses and changes the course of action.\n\n- \u201cYes, I think there\u2019s been some confusion. Let\u2019s go back to lodgings for a moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nReinforcement: The speaker restates a previous utterance for emphasis. This rewinds the flow of the conversation. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- \u201cCan you book me a room for Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights, please?\u201d... \u201cPlease recommend a hotel on Thursday for 3 people, 2 nights as far east as possible.\u201d... \u201cThere are no guesthouses for 3 people for 2 nights starting on Thursday?\u201d... User: \u201cYes please book it for 3 people for 2 nights starting from Thursday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverspecification: The speaker states an objective fact where the reality is already externally observable by other means. This brings up additional overly specific information to the attention. This refines and adds to the flow of conversation and creates friction by stating a piece of self-evident information. Some more detailed examples and descriptions include:\n\n- The speaker gives more details, specificity, or unnecessary explanation about their actions or the environment. This adds to the conversation what was already known.\n\n- \u201ci cleaned the mug.\u201d (both interlocutors can see this, but the speaker says it nonetheless)\n\n- The speaker confirms while elaborating the actions, choices, or beliefs. Such as a repetition of the same utterances, more complex than yes or no answers, or longer than necessary responses.\n\n- \u201cGood news! I was able to book that for you. Will that be all?\u201d (instead of saying \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cbooked\u201d)\n\n\n\nProbing: The speaker poses a question regarding an external aspect of the conversation, such as the environment, the actions, or the interlocutors. This redirects the flow of the conversation to the other interlocutor from the speaker.\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the environment, actions, or the interlocutors in an effort to understand the context better.\n\n- instructor: \u201copen the drawer\u201d; follower: \u201cwhich one?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question to clarify something in the conversation.\n\n- \u201d What did you say again?\u201d\n\n- The speaker asks a question regarding the goal, reasoning or the plan in the conversation to plan out their actions better.\n\n- \u201cwhere are the plates?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with an example dialogue annotated with HTML tags.
